# pentest_tools

Some scripts I made for pentesting.

### tcp_portscan

[ sudo is required for paquet forging ]<br />
It is a multi-processes TCP port scan. You can scan either with the TCP Connect technique ( three-way handshake ) or with
the SYN technique ( SYN, SYN/ACK, RST ).

### ip_range

[ sudo is required for paquet forging ]<br />
It is a ip scanner. You give it a IP range ( like 127.0.0.1-254 ) and it will search for devices. If you don't specify range, it
will search for devices in the local network ( an internet connetion is necessary to get the local IP adress ).
